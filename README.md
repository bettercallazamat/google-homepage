Google Main Page

This is my project for Pre-Course of Microverse.

I have build google main page and made it looks like official one. 
During this project I have learned how to:
- build nav bar
- place elements on right/left
- build footer and finding roundabout ways to accomplish designing
- building simple form and designing it

If u on this page, I would really glad to get feedback on my project.
